        "description" : ["Falcon 9 is on the pad at the SpaceX launch site, Space Launch Complex 40, on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, where it is undergoing final checkouts for its inaugural flight. The first test launch attempt is currently scheduled for Friday 4 June, 2010, with a second day on Saturday 5 June, 2010. On both days, the launch window opens at 11:00 AM Eastern / 8:00 AM Pacific / 1500 UTC, and lasts for four hours.", "The Falcon 9 is an all-new vehicle, designed and developed in the 21st Century, and launching from a completely remodeled launch site. With this launch attempt SpaceX seeks to demonstrate the complete Falcon 9 system, which includes all of the ground operations, range and launch support systems, as well as the Falcon 9 rocket itself.", "On this initial test flight, the Falcon 9 will be carrying a Dragon spacecraft qualification unit, gathering valuable aerodynamic and performance data for the Falcon 9 configuration that will fly on the following Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) and Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) missions for NASA. The Dragon on this demonstration flight is structurally and aerodynamically equivalent to a fully operational Dragon spacecraft. However, it lacks some elements such as heat shield, thrusters and a recovery system, so it is on a one-way mission and will not be recovered.", "The Falcon 9 launch site at Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40), on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), is located on the Atlantic coast of Florida, approximately 5.5 km (3.5 miles) southeast of NASA's space shuttle launch site. Starting in 1965, SLC-40 saw the launch of a total of 55 Titan III and Titan IV rockets, including the 1997 launch of NASA's Cassini spacecraft, now orbiting Saturn. The Titan rockets were among the largest vehicles in the US fleet – second only to the giant Saturn V moon rocket. The last Titan IV launch from SLC-40 occurred in April of 2005, and in November of 2007 SpaceX received permission to begin upgrading and renovating the complex for Falcon 9 launches. During flight preparations and launch, SpaceX employs the extensive range safety, tracking, telemetry and other services provided by CCAFS.", "The success of the inaugural Falcon 9 flight will be measured as a percentage of how many flight milestones SpaceX is able to complete during this first launch attempt. It is important to note that since this is a test launch, SpaceX’s primary goal is to collect as much data as possible. It would be a great day if we reach orbital velocity, but still a good day if the first stage functions correctly, even if the second stage malfunctions. It would be a bad day if something happens on the launch pad itself and we’re not able to gain any flight data. On a bad day, it will be disappointing, but one launch does not make or break SpaceX as a company, nor commercial spaceflight as an industry. The Atlas rocket only succeeded on its 13th flight, and today it is the most reliable vehicle in the American fleet. Regardless of the outcome, this first launch attempt represents a key milestone for both SpaceX and the commercial spaceflight industry."],

        "description" : ["SpaceX is currently targeting Tuesday, December 7th, 2010 for the first launch attempt of the first demo flight for the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, with December 8th and 9th and backup dates. This is the first-ever test flight of a Dragon spacecraft, an entirely new spacecraft designed in the last decade, and only the second ever test flight of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle. It also marks the first time a commercial company is attempting to re-enter a spacecraft from orbit. On the days identified, the launch window opens at 9:03 AM EST / 6:03 AM PST / 15:03 UTC and closes at 12:20 PM EST / 9:20 PST / 18:20 UTC.", "This is the first flight under NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program to develop commercial supply services to the International Space Station and encourage the growth of the commercial space industry. COTS is also an acronym used by government acquisition officials for commercial off-the -shelf, meaning that the government should, when possible, take advantage of commercially available products of equal quality and utility when doing so is the most cost-effective option. After the Space Shuttle retires, SpaceX will make at least 12 flights to carry cargo to and from the International Space Station as part of a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract for NASA awarded in 2008. The $1.6 billion contract represents a minimum of 12 flights, with an option to order additional missions for up to $3.1 billion. Only SpaceX has the ability to return cargo from the station. This has been a strong government-commercial partnership. SpaceX has only come this far by building upon the incredible achievements of NASA, having NASA as an anchor tenant for launch, and receiving expert advice and mentorship throughout the development process. With the savings NASA will see by using SpaceX for low-Earth transportation, billions of dollars are freed up for other activities such as accelerating exploration efforts that go beyond low-Earth orbit, advanced telescopes and Earth science missions. The Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft were designed to one day carry astronauts; both the COTS and CRS missions will yield valuable flight experience toward this goal.", "The Dragon spacecraft, although much smaller, is just as complex as the Falcon 9. In addition to being the first flight of an operational Dragon, there are many new systems and elements that will be tested for the first time in space — structural integrity of the pressure vessel, precision firing of the 18 SpaceX Draco engines, telemetry, guidance, navigation and control systems, the heat shield, and parachutes—to name a few. It is also the first attempt by a commercial company to recover a spacecraft reentering from low-Earth orbit, a feat only performed by 5 nations - the United States, Russia, China, Japan, and India – and the European Space Agency. The June 4th launch included a Dragon that was aerodynamically equivalent to a fully operational Dragon spacecraft but lacked elements such as the heat shield, propulsion thrusters, avionics, or a recovery system, and was not recovered.", "After traveling approximately 50,000 miles, the Dragon spacecraft is expected to land in the Pacific about 500 miles off of the coast of Mexico approximately three and a half hours after launch. The landing location is controlled by firing the Draco thrusters during reentry. On this mission, Dragon would be recovered by ship. Long term, once SpaceX has proven our ability to control reentry accurately, we intend to add deployable landing gear to touch down on land. In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual drogue parachutes deploy at 45,000 feet to stabilize and slow the spacecraft. Full deployment of the drogues triggers the release of the main parachutes, each 116 feet in diameter, at about 10,000 feet, with the drogues detaching from the spacecraft. Main parachutes further slow the spacecraft's descent to approximately 16-18 ft/sec. Oversized parachutes are critical in ensuring a safe landing for crew members. Even if Dragon were to lose one of its main parachutes, the two remaining chutes would still ensure a safe landing. Both the Dragon spacecraft and the first stage of the Falcon 9 are designed to be reusable. Reusability is a key element to SpaceX’s long term goal of increasing the reliability and reducing the cost of spaceflight by a factor of ten. NASA’s MV Freedom Star recovery ship, normally responsible for recovering the space shuttle’s solid rocket boosters, will be used should recovery of the Falcon 9 rocket’s first stage be possible. Reusability is a long term goal. SpaceX expects to make progress on this goal, but full recovery will take many missions to achieve."],

At the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., a Falcon 9 rocket belonging to Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), is being prepared to place its Dragon spacecraft into orbit on a test mission to the orbital outpost. Working for the past six years under NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program (COTS), both SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corp. have been pursuing independent efforts to design, test and fly two brand new cargo vehicles. These will provide the United States with safe, reliable and efficient cargo delivery services to the orbiting complex NASA built with its international partners.", "The first COTS demonstration flight that SpaceX completed was in December 2010, where it proved that it could launch, orbit and recover its Dragon spacecraft. Prior to that, the maiden flight of the Falcon 9 demonstrated it could launch a Dragon capsule simulator atop a Falcon 9 rocket. This upcoming mission will prove that Dragon can rendezvous and berth with the International Space Station. After launching from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Dragon will begin its journey to the space station. Just under 10 minutes after launch, Dragon will reach its preliminary orbit, deploy its solar arrays and begin a carefully choreographed series of engine firings to reach the station. During this part of the flight, Dragon will demonstrate the first set of tests as part of its COTS milestone requirements. The spacecraft will perform a test of its Absolute GPS (AGPS) system, using global positioning system satellites to determine its location. It also will conduct a free drift demonstration, allowing the spacecraft to float freely with all of its thrusters inhibited. Then Dragon will perform a demonstration of its abort capability, to ensure it could move away from the station if necessary.", "The Dragon spacecraft is targeted to land in the Pacific, a few hundred miles west of Southern California. The landing location is controlled by firing the Draco thrusters during reentry. In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual drogue parachutes deploy at 45,000 feet to stabilize and slow the spacecraft. Full deployment of the drogues triggers the release of the main parachutes, each 116 feet in diameter, at about 10,000 feet, with the drogues detaching from the spacecraft. Main parachutes further slow the spacecraft's descent to approximately 16 to 18 feet per second. Oversized parachutes are critical in ensuring a safe landing for crew members. Even if Dragon were to lose one of its main parachutes, the two remaining chutes would still ensure a safe landing. SpaceX will use a 185 -foot working barge equipped with a crane and pulled by a tug boat, an 80 -foot crew boat, and two 25 -foot rigid hull inflatable boats (RIB) to conduct recovery operations. On board will be approximately a dozen SpaceX engineers and technicians as well as a 4 -person dive team. When Dragon returns, the boats will be waiting outside the targeted landing area, which is a few days’ journey from land. Once Dragon lands in the water, the 25 - foot boats will carry the experienced dive team to the floating spacecraft. They will secure the vehicle and tow it to the barge, where the crane will pick it up and place it on deck. On this mission, Dragon will be recovered by ship. Long term, once SpaceX has proven the ability to control reentry accurately, we intend to add deployable landing gear to touch down on land."],

The fairing separates using pneumatic pushers instead of explosives and is large enough to fit a city bus.  This was also the first launch from SpaceX’s newly refurbished launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base, and the first demonstration of a number of technologies on the upgraded vehicle.", "On this mission, Falcon 9 lifted off with nine Merlin 1D engines, generating 1.3 million pounds of  thrust at liftoff and increasing to 1.5 million pounds of thrust as it approached the vacuum of space—nearly twice the thrust than when previously powered by  the Merlin 1C. The engines were configured in a more robust engine support structure called the Octaweb, which is easier to manufacture and improves the vehicles reliability. To fuel the more powerful engines, SpaceX extended the propellant tanks by approximately 60%. The upgraded vehicle featured a triple-redundant avionics system similar to that used on Dragon, providing a single-fault tolerant architecture. A new stage separation system reduced the number of connection points from 12 to 3, and the vehicle also flew with a stronger heat shield that allows the rocket to reenter Earth’s atmosphere and eventually land propulsively.", "The flight proceeded according to plan, with a nominal first-stage flight and shutdown 2 minutes and 41 seconds after launch. Stage separation occurred at 2 minutes and 45 seconds, with MVac ignition following 7 seconds later. SpaceX's new fairing separated at approximately 3 minutes 32 seconds into launch. Nine minutes and 2 seconds into flight, the upper stage engine shut down. Approximately 14 minutes into flight, CASSIOPE was deployed directly at its target orbit of 325x1500km, 81 deg inclination.

The launch occurred at 4:10pm EDT and while weather had remained a concern during the countdown, Falcon 9 executed a picture-perfect liftoff into a nearly cloudless sky. Falcon 9 was carrying the Dragon spacecraft, which is loaded with about 4,300 pounds of supplies and payloads bound for the International Space Station (ISS).", "Approximately three minutes into flight, Falcon 9’s second stage and Dragon separated from the rocket’s first stage. The second stage’s single Merlin Vacuum engine ignited for a seven-minute burn to deliver Dragon to its initial orbit. Dragon separated from Falcon 9 approximately 10 minutes into flight, and began deploying its solar arrays shortly thereafter. Below the solar array fairings can be seen separating from the spacecraft.", "Dragon will now begin a two-and-a-half day journey to reach the ISS. It is targeted to be grappled by the station’s robotic arm on Friday, April 17 at approximately 7:00am EDT, with berthing and hatch opening occurring over the following day. Meanwhile, Falcon 9’s first stage attempted a precision landing on our autonomous spaceport drone ship named “Just Read the Instructions” as part of an ongoing attempt to land and recover a rocket after it completes its primary mission. The stage made it to the drone ship and landed, but excess lateral velocity caused it to tip over."],

Preliminary analysis suggests the vehicle experienced an overpressure event in the upper stage liquid oxygen tank approximately 139 seconds into flight.

Investigation teams are examining over 3,000 channels of telemetry data received from the vehicle, and engineers are parsing data with a hex editor to recover the final milliseconds of the flight. SpaceX is also supporting daily meetings with NASA and the Air Force, with the FAA providing oversight.", "The process for determining the root cause of Sunday’s mishap is complex, and there is no one theory yet that is consistent with the data. Our engineering teams are heads down reviewing every available piece of flight data as we work through a thorough fault tree analysis, additional updates will be posted as they become available."],

        "description" : ["Investigators scoured more than 3,000 channels of video and telemetry data covering a very brief timeline of events – there were just 93 milliseconds from the first sign of anomalous data to the loss of the second stage, followed by loss of the vehicle. Because the failure occurred on the ground, investigators were also able to review umbilical data, ground-based video, and physical debris. To validate investigation analysis and findings, SpaceX conducted a wide range of tests at its facilities in Hawthorne, California and McGregor, Texas.", "The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis and concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed. Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner, leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.", "Each stage of Falcon 9 uses COPVs to store cold helium which is used to maintain tank pressure, and each COPV consists of an aluminum inner liner with a carbon overwrap. The recovered COPVs showed buckles in their liners. Although buckles were not shown to burst a COPV on their own, investigators concluded that super chilled LOX can pool in these buckles under the overwrap. When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail. In addition, investigators determined that the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen (SOX), which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.", "The investigation team identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX in buckles under the overwrap. The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads. In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the COPVs to prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations.​"],
